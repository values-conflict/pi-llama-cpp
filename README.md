# pi-llama-cpp

A [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev/) extension that integrates with running [llama.cpp servers](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) to provide live model browsing, loading, and switching directly from Pi.

## Features

- **Auto-detect models** — discovers all models available on your running llama.cpp server
- **Live status indicators** — see which models are loaded, loading, failed, sleeping, or unloaded with color-coded icons
- **Load / unload / switch** — manage models directly from the Pi command palette
- **Multi-model router support** — works with both single-model and multi-model llama.cpp server configurations
- **Image capabilities detection** — detects multimodal models automatically
- **Flexible URL resolution** — configures the server URL via project config, environment variable, or global settings
- **Auth support** — allows to login into a llama.cpp server that was secured with an API key
- **Multiple server support** — connect to multiple llama.cpp servers simultaneously by separating URLs with semicolons
- **Thinking budget support** — configurable token budgets for model reasoning/thinking, mapped to Pi's thinking levels
- **Real-time progress tracking** — live loading progress via SSE (falls back to polling)
- **Inference status display** — prefill progress bar and generation speed shown in Pi's working message during conversations
- **Generation TPS metrics** — live tokens-per-second, token count, and elapsed time displayed after prompt processing completes

### Status Indicators

| Icon | Status       | Description                            |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 🟢   | Loaded       | Model is active and ready to use       |
| 🟡   | Loading      | Model is currently being loaded        |
| 🔴   | Failed       | Model failed to load                   |
| 🔵   | Sleeping     | Model is available, but inactive       |
| ⚪   | Unloaded     | Model is not loaded on the server      |
| ⛔   | Unauthorized | Model can't be used (API key required) |

> **Note**: The `Sleeping` status only shows when you start your server with `llama-server --sleep-idle-seconds <n> ...`.
> This is a **llama.cpp server flag** that tells the server to put idle models to sleep after `n` seconds.
> The model awakens automatically when you send a message.

> **Note:** You can run your server with API authentication with `llama-server --api-key <your key> ...`.

## Installation

This package is a Pi extension. Install it with

```bash
pi install npm:pi-llama-cpp
```

or

```bash
pi install https://github.com/gsanhueza/pi-llama-cpp
```

## Configuration

The extension resolves the llama.cpp server URL(s) using the following priority order:

1. **Per-project config** — `.pi/settings.json` in your project root:

   ```json
   {
     "llamaServerUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   }
   ```

2. **Environment variable** — `LLAMA_SERVER_URL`

3. **Global settings** — `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "llamaServerUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
   }
   ```

4. **Default** — `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Multiple Servers

To connect to multiple llama.cpp servers simultaneously, add your URLs as a single string **separated with semicolons** in any of the examples above:

```bash
# Example for env, but you can use any of the other methods
LLAMA_SERVER_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080;http://127.0.0.1:8081;http://10.0.0.5:8080"
```

Each server gets its own provider (e.g., **Llama.cpp (http://127.0.0.1:8080)**) and its own set of models. The `/models` command lists all models from all servers, labeled with their server URL.

### API Key

If your llama.cpp server requires authentication, use `/login` in Pi, select the "API key" option, and choose the provider from the list that correlates with the server needing the API key.

Alternatively, configure the API key in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`:
Use the provider ID `llama-server=<url>`:

```json
{
  "llama-server=http://127.0.0.1:8080": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "<key-for-server-1>"
  },
  "llama-server=https://some-url-for-llama-cpp": {
    "type": "api_key",
    "key": "<key-for-server-2>"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure your llama.cpp server is running with the appropriate flags.

- For multi-model support (model router), start the server with:

```bash
llama-server --models-preset path/to/presets.ini ...
```

- For single-model mode, start the server with:

```bash
llama-server --model path/to/model.gguf ...
```

- For legacy-model mode (e.g., [ik_llama.cpp](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp)), the extension auto-detects and handles it transparently.

> **Note:** This extension is focused on llama.cpp, not on ik_llama.cpp. Nonetheless, since I found a way to make it work with this extension, I added the option.

> **Note:** The ik_llama.cpp fork is not legacy at all, but it uses an old way of describing models compared to llama.cpp.

The extension determines the context size as follows:

- **Router mode**
  - When loaded, reads `meta.n_ctx` from the `/v1/models` endpoint
  - When not loaded, reads `--ctx-size` and/or `--fit-ctx` from the server arguments (which can also originate from the **presets.ini** file the llama.cpp server uses to load its models).
- **Single mode** — reads `meta.n_ctx` from the `/v1/models` endpoint
- **Legacy mode** — reads `max_model_len` from `/v1/models`, falling back to `n_ctx` from `/props`
- Falls back to `128000` if not available

### Commands

| Command          | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/models`        | Browse your models with live status. Select a model to load, switch, or unload it. |
| `/models info`   | Show detailed information for all available models at once.                        |
| `/models unload` | Unload all loaded models at once.                                                  |

> **Note:** When a llama.cpp server is slow to respond, it will be skipped at startup with a warning. Run `/models` to retry without timeout and see all models.

> **Note:** When a llama.cpp server is unreachable, `/models` displays an error notification with the configured server URL, but healthy servers continue to show their models.

> **Note:** The `/models unload` command only makes sense in router mode.

### Model Actions

When browsing models via the `/models` command, you can:

- **Load & switch** — Load an unloaded model and switch to it
- **Switch model** — Switch to a model that is already loaded
- **Unload** — Unload a loaded model to free memory
- **Retry** — Retry loading a failed model
- **Info** — View model details (ID, capabilities, context size)
- **Cancel** — Cancel the current operation

> **Note:** In single-model and legacy-model mode, **Unload** is not available, since there is only one model on the server.

### Thinking Budgets

The extension supports configurable **thinking budgets** that control how many tokens the model allocates to its reasoning/thinking process.
This is tied to Pi's thinking level selector (off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh, max).

| Level     | Tokens | Description                  |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `off`     | 0      | Thinking disabled            |
| `minimal` | 1,024  | Short reasoning steps        |
| `low`     | 2,048  | Light reasoning              |
| `medium`  | 8,192  | Balanced reasoning (default) |
| `high`    | 16,384 | Extended reasoning           |
| `xhigh`   | 32,768 | Deep reasoning               |
| `max`     | -1     | Unlimited reasoning          |

User-defined budgets can override the defaults by adding a `thinkingBudgets` object to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (global) or `.pi/settings.json` (per-project):

```json
{
  "thinkingBudgets": {
    "minimal": 256,
    "low": 1024,
    "medium": 2048,
    "high": 4096,
    "xhigh": 8192
  }
}
```

Only `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high` and `xhigh` are configurable — `off` (0) and `max` (-1, unlimited) are fixed.
The extension automatically injects the appropriate `thinking_budget_tokens` into each request payload based on the selected level.

### Model Selection Event

When you switch models via Pi's model picker (instead of using the `/models` command), the extension listens for the `model_select` event, which also loads the requested model before the conversation begins.

This keeps the server in sync with the active model in Pi, regardless of how the switch was initiated — you don't need to manually load models before using them.

> **Note:** If you switch sessions while a model load is in-flight, you'll see a warning, but the load continues in the background. Use `/models` in the new session to verify the model status.

### Loading Models

When you trigger a load, switch, or retry action, the extension uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) to receive real-time progress updates from the server. If SSE is not available, it falls back to polling.

If loading takes longer than **60 seconds**, the operation times out with an error.

> **Note:** The timeout only applies to the progress detection. The model might still be loading in the background.

### Inference Status

During a conversation with a llama.cpp model, the extension intercepts server responses to show real-time inference progress in Pi's working message area.

**Prefill phase** — while the model processes your prompt, you'll see a progress bar:
```
Prefilling... ████████████░░░░░░░░ 65% · 12s · 48.3 tok/s
```
The estimated time remaining is projected from recent throughput samples using a rate curve fit.
Instantaneous tokens-per-second (tok/s) is shown alongside the percentage complete.

**Generation phase** — after prefill completes, you'll see live generation stats:
```
🤔 28.5 tok/s · 142 tokens in 5.0s
```
This uses server-side GPU timing from llama.cpp (not wall-clock), so network latency and Pi processing overhead don't affect the displayed speed.

> **Note:** The prefill time-remaining estimate and tok/s calculations are based on the approach from [pi-token-speed](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-token-speed), adapted to use llama.cpp's provided data directly (`prompt_progress` and `timings_per_token`) instead of counting streaming deltas.
> 
> **Note:** This feature replaces the standalone [pi-llama-cpp-stats](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-llama-cpp-stats) extension — it is now built-in. If you have both installed, only this one will be active for llama.cpp servers.

### Model Configuration

Each model exposed to Pi includes the following defaults:

- **`maxTokens`** — dynamically set to the model's context window (detected from llama-server)
- **`reasoning`** — `true` (assumed, as llama.cpp's `/v1/models` endpoint does not expose it)
- **`cost`** — all zero (local models)
